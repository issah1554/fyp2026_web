Smart Market and Price Decision Support System
Using Multi-Source Market Data Analytics and USSD Technology
Project Overview
The Smart Market and Price Decision Support System is an intelligent market information platform designed to improve access to accurate, timely, and reliable market information for entrepreneurs, farmers, and buyers. The system addresses the challenges of information asymmetry, unreliable pricing information, and limited market intelligence, particularly in rural communities such as Ifakara, Tanzania.

The platform integrates data from multiple sources, including market officers, traders, online marketplaces, social media platforms, e-commerce websites, and publicly available APIs. Using data analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning techniques, the system analyzes market trends, predicts future commodity prices, and generates recommendations that support informed decision-making.

To ensure accessibility for all users, including those without internet connectivity, the system provides both web-based and USSD-based interfaces, allowing users to access market information using smartphones or basic mobile phones.

Problem Statement
Many farmers, entrepreneurs, and buyers rely on informal communication channels such as word-of-mouth, local traders, and physical market visits to obtain market information. These methods are often unreliable, time-consuming, and do not provide real-time market intelligence.

The lack of accurate market information results in:

Information asymmetry between buyers and sellers.
Poor bargaining power for farmers.
Reduced profitability and business opportunities.
Inefficient resource allocation.
Poor production and investment decisions.
The proposed system aims to address these challenges by providing a centralized and intelligent market information platform.
